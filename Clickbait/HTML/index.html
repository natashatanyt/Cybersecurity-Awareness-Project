    <h1>Clickbait & Misinformation</h1>

    <div class="container-fluid introduction-content">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Clickbait is when a misleading headline is used, often appealing to emotion or curiosity, enticing readers to click on the article, and allowing them to generate revenue. Often, the content of the article does not match the headline or
        contains information from non-credible sources.<br />
        As a result of clickbait titles, misinformation can spread. These articles are intentionally false, and are designed to manipulate people’s perceptions of the truth. These use titles that are similar to clickbait, appealing to shock and anger
        to entice people to click on the article, which is intentionally false and misleading. The goal is to manipulate people’s perception of truth, as they may be misled into believing something that is wrong.<br />
        Young children may not be aware of clickbait titles and may believe everything to be true, especially if it looks to be from a legitimate source. Some articles are incredibly convincing, and can even fool adults. If they share these clickbait
        articles, their friends may also fall for these misleading articles, and form misinformed opinions.<br />
        By believing and spreading these fake news articles, your child and their peers may start to form the wrong opinions and believe things that are untrue. Without realization, they may be affected and align with these articles, which can be
        very damaging to them in the future, as these opinions will take a long time to unlearn. It can also undermine their credibility due to their warped perception of reality.

    <!--- Avoiding Clickbait --->
    <h2>Avoiding Clickbait</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Think before you click</b> - If the headline sounds too good to be true, it may be clickbait</li>
      <li><b>Avoid clicking on headlines that shock you</b> - These headlines are likely to be clickbait</li>
      <li><b>Check the source</b> - Some news sites are intentionally satirical, but may be presented as being true</li>
      <li><b>Read the article before you share</b> - If the article seems outlandish or has little to do with the headline, it is likely to be clickbait.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Deepfakes</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Deepfakes are videos with audio and/or visual content that was manipulated to edit someone’s face, body, or voice onto something else, making it seem like they are doing something they have not done. These videos are dangerous as they can be
      used to spread lies, tricking the public into believing something that did not actually happen.<br />
      It is important to teach your child about deepfakes to ensure that they will not be fooled by them, as deepfakes can be used to spread misinformation. It can put someone in a precarious situation, as they are shown to be doing or saying
      something they have never said, damaging someone’s reputation.<br />
      As a result, the victim may also be doxxed, as others may be enraged and want to hurt the victim based on what is said in the video, unaware that it is fake. Thus, spreading these videos, or being a victim of these videos, can be very
      dangerous.
