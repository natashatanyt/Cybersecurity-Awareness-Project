      <p>
        Doxxing occurs when someone posts personally identifiable information about a person online, with the intent of causing harm/distress. Victims are usually doxxed when they have some form of disagreement with the attacker, who posts the
        information publicly, with a call to attack, harass or threaten the victim. As a result, the person could be put in an uncomfortable and deadly situation, as others may physically threaten the victim.
        <br>
        Children may participate, unknowingly, in doxxing, under the guise of social justice, believing they are in the right by sharing information about a person who has previously done wrong. Amongst children, doxxing can also take place when
        private information about an individual is made public without their consent and is a form of cyber-bullying.
        <br>
        Being doxxed can result in stalkers, threats of violence, and a lack of privacy for the victim and their family. It can be very stressful if your child is a victim of doxxing, as their personal information will be released and available
        online, for anyone to see. Additionally, your child may not be aware that their actions are considered doxxing, and may face <a href="https://singaporelegaladvice.com/law-articles/laws-penalties-doxxing-singapore-examples/">legal consequences</a>. Thus,
        it is important to educate your child about the consequences of doxxing so they can protect themselves online.
        <br>
        If you are doxxed, you should immediately report the post and make a police report.

  <!--- How Information is Gathered --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h1>How Information is Gathered</h1>
    <h2>Tracking Usernames</h2>
    <p>Most people use the same username across many accounts, especially on social media, as it allows their followers to find them easily across platforms. If they use the same usernames, it is easy for attackers to understand how the victim spends
      their time on the internet.</p>
    <h2>Phishing</h2>
    <p><a href="../../Social Engineering/HTML/index.html">Phishing</a> is an easy way for attackers to gain access to the victimâ€™s personal and sensitive information.</p>
    <h2>Stalking on Social Media</h2>
    <p>If your information is public, anyone can find out information about you by looking through your posts. This allows them to learn about you, potentially figuring out answers to security questions.</p>

  <!--- Prevent Doxxing --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h1>Preventing Doxxing</h1>
    <h2>Doxx Yourself</h2>
    <p>
      By doxxing yourself, you will be able to find out what information is publicly available about you, which will help you figure out what you need to remove from your accounts to maintain your privacy.
      <br>
      Unsure of how to start? The New York Times released a document with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AyDO5QDp9UUbHHGT3d9JpcTni94xpY66q657a8rDz4I/edit">a guide on how to doxx yourself, along with various other resources.</a>
      Some of these resources are not applicable to Singapore, such as the list of Data Broker Sites and Opt-out List.
      The link to the original article <a href="https://open.nytimes.com/how-to-dox-yourself-on-the-internet-d2892b4c5954">can be found here.</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Use Anti-malware Software</h2>
    <p>Attackers are able to spy on you with malware. By downloading anti-malware software and regularly checking your device for malware, you can prevent attackers from tracking you and gathering information about you.</p>

    <h2>Use Strong Passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication</h2>
    <p>By <a href="../../Password Safety/HTML/index.html">using strong and different passwords</a>, it is harder for attackers to log in to your accounts on multiple platforms, making it more difficult for them to gain access to your sensitive
      information.
      <br>
      With <a href="../../Multi-Factor Authentication/HTML/index.html">multi-factor authentication</a>, even if the attacker has your username and password, it is difficult for the attacker to gain access to your account, as they need another
      verification step that only you have access to.
    </p>

    <h2>Use Maximal Privacy Settings on Social Media</h2>
    <p>Encourage your child to set their personal accounts to have the strongest privacy settings, keeping all personal information private. This prevents attackers from being able to publicly gather information about your child.</p>
