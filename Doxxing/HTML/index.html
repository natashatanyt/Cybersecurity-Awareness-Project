  <!--- Introduction --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Doxxing occurs when personally identifiable information is posted online, with the intent of causing harm/distress. This may happen as an act of revenge for various reasons, and puts the victim in an unsafe situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      People may share a person’s information, believing it is justified under the guise of social justice. As a result of doxxing, the victim may be stalked, or face threats of violence. In Singapore, doxxing
      is illegal and <a href="https://singaporelegaladvice.com/law-articles/laws-penalties-doxxing-singapore-examples/">attackers will face consequences</a>. If you are doxxed, you should immediately take screenshots as evidence, report the post and
      make a police report.
    </p>

    <!--- How Information is Gathered --->
    <h1>How Information is Gathered</h1>
    <h2 class="reduce-margin">Tracking Usernames</h2>
    <p>
      People use the same username on different platforms and accounts, making it easy for followers to find them on multiple websites. However, it is also easy for an attacker to find accounts and collate shared information.
    </p>

    <h2>Phishing</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="../../Social Engineering/HTML/index.html">Phishing</a> is an easy way for attackers to gain access to a person’s sensitive information. With access to their account, attackers can view information that the person chose to hide from the
      public.
    </p>

    <h2>Stalking on Social Media</h2>
    <p>
      If your account is public, anyone can find out information about you by looking through your posts. If you are not careful with what you share, attackers can figure out your personal information from looking at your posts.
    </p>
  </div>


  <!--- Prevent Doxxing --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h1>Preventing Doxxing</h1>
    <h2 class="reduce-margin">Doxx Yourself</h2>
    <p>
      By doxxing yourself, you will be able to find out what information is publicly available about you. If you are unsure of how to start, the New York Times released a document with <a
        href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AyDO5QDp9UUbHHGT3d9JpcTni94xpY66q657a8rDz4I/edit">a guide on how to doxx yourself.</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Use Anti-malware Software</h2>
    <p>
      Attackers are able to spy on you with malware. By downloading anti-malware software and regularly scanning your devices, you can prevent attackers from tracking you and gathering information about you.
    </p>

    <h2>Use Strong Passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication</h2>
    <p>
      By <a href="../../Password Safety/HTML/index.html">using strong passwords</a>, it is harder for attackers to log in to all your accounts, making it more difficult for them to gain access to your sensitive information.
    </p>
    <p>
      With <a href="../../Multi-Factor Authentication/HTML/index.html">multi-factor authentication</a>, even if the attacker has your username and password, it is hard for them to gain access to your account, as they need another verification step
      that only you have access to.
    </p>

    <h2>Use Maximal Privacy Settings</h2>
    <p>
      Set your personal accounts to have the strongest privacy settings, and keep all personal information private. This prevents attackers from being able to publicly gather information about you.
