        These days, many children are involved with online games, and may even take part in eSports, which are online gaming tournaments. They can use it as a way to bond with their friends without needing to be in the same physical space. However,
        as with most online platforms, there are dangers that can deeply affect you and your child. By educating them about these dangers, you can help make their online gaming experience safer.

  <!--- Dangers of Online Gaming --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h1>Dangers of Online Gaming</h1>
    <p>
      Most games that your child plays will allow people of all ages to play and interact with each other without restrictions. This can be incredibly dangerous due to predatory behavior, where older adults will attempt to befriend your child with
      the intention of exploiting them, in an act known as <a href="../../Social Media/HTML/index.html">grooming</a>.
      <br>
      Your child may overshare personal information, revealing personally identifiable information which would allow others to identify them. Others may be able to figure out which school your child belongs to, or what their address is, which may
      result in them being stalked.
      <br>
      Additionally, some games may be incredibly addictive and may offer in-game purchases with real-life money to give players a boost or special characters/items. This can be dangerous if your child is prone to impulse buying, or if they are
      unaware that their actions will cost real-life money, <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cnainsider/spent-parents-money-mystery-loot-boxes-gaming-problem-gambling-2050696">which can result in thousands of dollars spent without
        realization</a>.
      <br>
      It is important to educate your child about the dangers of online gaming as it will help them think twice before spending real-life money on games, or falling prey to addiction. Moreover, it is important to remind them to be careful of what
      they share online, especially with people they have never met in person.
    </p>

    <h2>Downloading Games Illegally</h2>
    <p>
      Your child may choose to seek alternative sources to download games, especially if they do not want to, or do not have the means to, spend money to buy the game through legal and official means. Thus, they will go to suspicious and unverified
      sources to download games, in an illegal act known as <em>pirating</em>.
      <br>
      Apart from the legal consequences, files from these websites often contain <a href="../../Malware/HTML/index.html">malware</a>. This is dangerous as a device infected with malware can be used to spy on its users. As a result, information, such
      as login details and device usage can be sent to the attacker, potentially giving them access to the victimâ€™s accounts.
    </p>

  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">


    <h2>Sharing Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
      Children may be very naive and trusting when online and may share personal information as they feel that they are in a safe space. When playing games with online friends, they may feel as though they are real-life friends, which encourages them
      to open up to others more.
      <br>
      However, on an online platform, you cannot be sure that the person you are speaking to is who they claim to be. If your child chooses to reveal personal information to a stranger with malicious intent, they could end up being stalked, online or
      offline, and potentially be put in dangerous situations.
    </p>

  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">


    <h2>Gacha Games</h2>
    <p>
      Gacha games are a common and popular type of game. Players are encouraged to spend money to open boxes to collect items, cards, and/or characters. These usually have a tiered system, with popular, higher-tiered items being harder to find. They
      are highly random in nature and prompt players to spend in-game currency, which makes them very addictive. When players run out of in-game currency, they can use real-life money to obtain more in-game currency, or buy these boxes directly, in
      hopes of drawing higher-tiered items.
      <br>
      As they are young, they may not fully understand the consequences of their actions, and may not realize they are spending real-life money. Additionally, they may spend money without their parents realizing, especially if there is an automatic
      payment system set up, as payment can be done with just a single click. Thus, it is important to educate your child on this topic and to encourage them to ask for your permission before buying anything.

  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">


    <h2>Addiction</h2>
    Moreover, these games can be incredibly addictive. Young children may seek instant gratification and can end up spending hours on gaming applications without realization. If unregulated, they may choose to spend time on games instead of
    schoolwork or relationships, neglecting other aspects of their lives.
    <br>
    Addiction can happen even without the Gacha aspect of games, as children may see these games as a way for them to escape from any problems they have in daily life.
    <br>
    The thrill of Gacha games can also be extremely addictive to children. As it is virtual, they may not feel the impact and weight of their actions if they choose to spend real-world money, and may spend thousands of dollars in minutes without
    understanding what they have done.
