  <!--- Introduction --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      These days, many children play games online, using it as a way to bond with their friends without needing to be in the same physical space. However, as with most online platforms, there are dangers that can affect your child. By educating them
      about these dangers, you can help make their online gaming experience safer.

  <!--- Dangers of Online Gaming --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h1>Dangers of Online Gaming</h1>
    <p>
      Most games that your child plays allows people of all ages to play and interact with each other without restrictions. This can be incredibly dangerous due to potential predatory behavior, where older adults attempt to befriend your child with
      the intention of exploiting them, in an act known as <a href="../../Social Media/HTML/index.html">grooming</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some games may be incredibly addictive and may offer in-game purchases with real-life money to give players a boost. If your child is prone to impulsive spending, or if they are unaware that their actions will cost real-life
      money, <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cnainsider/spent-parents-money-mystery-loot-boxes-gaming-problem-gambling-2050696">it can result in thousands of dollars spent without realization</a>.
    </p>

    <!--- Malware --->
    <h2>Malware</h2>
    <p>
      Your child may choose to seek alternative sources to download games, especially if they do not have the means to obtain the game through official means. Files from these websites often contain <a
        href="../../Malware/HTML/index.html">malware</a>, which will automatically run and can be used to spy on its users. As a result, information, such as login details and device usage can be sent to the attacker.
    </p>

    <!--- Oversharing --->
    <h2>Oversharing</h2>
    <p>
      Children may be very trusting when online and may share personal information as they feel that they are in a safe space. However, being online provides anonymity and you cannot be sure the person you are speaking to is who they claim to be. If
      your child chooses to reveal personal information to a stranger with malicious intent, they could potentially be put in dangerous situations.
    </p>

    <!--- Gacha Games --->
    <h2>Gacha Games</h2>
    <p>
      Gacha games are a common and popular type of game. Players are encouraged to open highly random boxes to obtain items and characters, with popular ones being harder to find. When players run out of in-game currency, they can use real-life money
      to obtain more boxes, in hopes of drawing rarer items.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young children who play this game may unknowingly spend real-life money to obtain more boxes, and may not understand the consequences of their actions. Additionally, they may spend money without their parents realizing, especially if there is
      an automatic payment system set up, as payment can be done with just a single click, potentially spending large sums of money.
