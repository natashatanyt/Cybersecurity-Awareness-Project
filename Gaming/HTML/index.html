  <!--- Introduction --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      These days, many children play games online, using it as a way to bond with their friends without needing to be in the same physical space. However, as with most online platforms, there are dangers that can affect you and your child. By
      educating them about these dangers, you can help make their online gaming experience safer.

  <!--- Dangers of Online Gaming --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h1>Dangers of Online Gaming</h1>
    <p>
      Most games that your child plays allows people of all ages to play and interact with each other without restrictions. This can be incredibly dangerous due to potential predatory behavior, where older adults attempt to befriend your child with
      the intention of exploiting them, in an act known as <a href="../../Social Media/HTML/index.html">grooming</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your child may overshare information, revealing personally identifiable information which would allow others to identify them. They may be able to figure out which school your child belongs to, or what their address is, resulting in them being
      stalked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, some games may be incredibly addictive and may offer in-game purchases with real-life money to give players a boost or special characters/items. This can be dangerous if your child is prone to impulse buying, or if they are
      unaware that their actions will cost real-life money, <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cnainsider/spent-parents-money-mystery-loot-boxes-gaming-problem-gambling-2050696">which can result in thousands of dollars spent without
        realization</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to educate your child about the dangers of online gaming as it will help them think twice before spending real-life money on games, or reduce the chances of addiction. Moreover, it is important to remind them to be careful of
      what they share online, especially with people they have never met in person.
    </p>

    <!--- Downloading Games Illegally--->
    <h2>Downloading Games Illegally</h2>
    <p>
      Your child may choose to seek alternative sources to download games, especially if they do not want to, or do not have the means to, spend money to buy the game through legal and official means. Thus, they will go to suspicious and unverified
      sources to download games, in an illegal act known as <em>pirating</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from the legal consequences, files from these websites often contain <a href="../../Malware/HTML/index.html">malware</a>. This is dangerous as a device infected with malware can be used to spy on its users. As a result, information, such
      as login details and device usage can be sent to the attacker, potentially giving them access to the victimâ€™s accounts.
    </p>

    <!--- Sharing Personal Information--->
    <h2>Sharing Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
      Children may be very naive and trusting when online and may share personal information as they feel that they are in a safe space. When playing games with online friends, they may feel as though they are real-life friends, which encourages them
      to open up to others more.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, on an online platform, you cannot be sure that the person you are speaking to is who they claim to be. If your child chooses to reveal personal information to a stranger with malicious intent, they could end up being stalked, online or
      offline, and potentially be put in dangerous situations.
    </p>

    <!--- Gacha Games --->
    <h2>Gacha Games</h2>
    <p>
      Gacha games are a common and popular type of game. Players are encouraged to spend in-game currency to open boxes to collect items, cards, and/or characters. These usually have a tiered system, with popular, higher-tiered items being harder to
      find. They are highly random in nature, which makes them very addictive. When players run out of in-game currency, they can use real-life money to obtain more boxes, in hopes of drawing higher-tiered items.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young children may not fully understand the consequences of their actions, unaware they are spending real-life money. Additionally, they may spend money without their parents realizing, especially if there is an automatic payment system set up,
      as payment can be done with just a single click, potentially spending large sums of money.
    </p>

    <!--- Addiction --->
    <h2>Addiction</h2>
    <p>
      Moreover, these games can be incredibly addictive. Young children may seek instant gratification and can spend hours on gaming without realization. If unregulated, they neglect other aspects of their lives, such as academics or friendships.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thrill of Gacha games can also be extremely addictive to children. As it is virtual, they may not feel the impact and weight of their actions and may spend thousands of dollars in minutes without understanding what they have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Addiction can happen even without the Gacha aspect of games, as children may see these games as a way for them to escape from any problems they have in daily life.
