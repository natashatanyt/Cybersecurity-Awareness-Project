    <h1>Quiz Review</h1>

    <p class="review-desc">You can review the questions and correct answers here! The correct answer is highlighted in green and an explanation is provided after the question.</p>

    <!--- Question 1--->
    <div class="qn-container">
      <h2 class="question">While playing an online game, a link appears on the screen, with no other instructions or words. The link is not related to the current game in any way. Should you click the link?</h2>
      <div class="choice-container">
        <p class="choice-prefix col-1">A</p>
        <p class="choice-text " data-number="1">Yes</p>
      </div>
      <div class="choice-container correct">
        <p class="choice-prefix col-1">B</p>
        <p class="choice-text" data-number="2">No</p>
      </div>
      <div class="explanation">
        <p>
          These links can show up as advertisements between rounds of your game, and when clicked, will redirect you to a website that can install malware onto your device without your knowledge. You should always be careful to not click on any
          unknown links/images.
        </p>

    <!--- Question 2 --->
    <div class="qn-container">
      <h2 class="question">While playing an online game, a stranger contacts you and offers to give you some limited-edition virtual item in exchange for real-life money, at a much cheaper rate than what you would pay in the store. Should you buy the
        item from them instead?</h2>
      <div class="choice-container correct">
        <p class="choice-prefix col-1">A</p>
        <p class="choice-text " data-number="1">Yes</p>
      </div>
      <div class="choice-container correct">
        <p class="choice-prefix col-1">B</p>
        <p class="choice-text" data-number="2">No</p>
      </div>
      <div class="explanation">
        <p>
          This offer seems too good to be true, and it is likely to be a scam. You should never buy in-game items from someone else, unless the transaction can be secured by the game itself, to ensure that you are not scammed.

    <!--- Question 3 --->
    <div class="qn-container">
      <h2 class="question">It is not okay to share personal information with online friends, especially if you have never met them before.</h2>
      <div class="choice-container correct">
        <p class="choice-prefix col-1">A</p>
        <p class="choice-text " data-number="1">Yes</p>

      <div class="choice-container">
        <p class="choice-prefix col-1">B</p>
        <p class="choice-text" data-number="2">No</p>
      </div>
      <div class="explanation">
        <p>
          Being online gives people a level of anonymity. When interacting with others online, you cannot be sure they are who they claim to be. By sharing personal information, you are giving others the ability to track you and figure out who you
          are, what you look like, etc. This is dangerous as they may be able to stalk you online or in-person.

    <!--- Question 4 --->
    <div class="qn-container">
      <h2 class="question">It is okay to buy something for yourself in-game without your parentâ€™s permission, with their credit card, especially if its only a few dollars.</h2>
      <div class="choice-container">
        <p class="choice-prefix col-1">A</p>
        <p class="choice-text " data-number="1">Yes</p>
      </div>
      <div class="choice-container correct">
        <p class="choice-prefix col-1">B</p>
        <p class="choice-text" data-number="2">No</p>
      </div>
      <div class="explanation">
        <p>
          You should not buy anything without your parent's permission. There may be hidden charges associated with any purchase, which you are not aware of. If you want to buy something in-game, ask your parents for permission.

    <!--- Question 5 --->
    <div class="qn-container">
      <h2 class="question">If you are meeting online friends in person for the first time, you should go with your parents.</h2>
      <div class="choice-container correct">
        <p class="choice-prefix col-1">A</p>
        <p class="choice-text " data-number="1">Yes</p>

      <div class="choice-container">
        <p class="choice-prefix col-1">B</p>
        <p class="choice-text" data-number="2">No</p>
      </div>
      <div class="explanation">
        <p>
          As mentioned, you cannot be certain that your online friends are who they claim to be. If you do want to meet them, ask your parents to accompany you. This way, your parents will be able to help you if the person you meet is not who they
          claim to be.
