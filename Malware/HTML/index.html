    <p>
      Attackers often disguise their threats as something harmless, when it is in fact malicious to efficiently execute their attacks. One such example is the aptly named Trojan virus, which presents itself as a legitimate file or website link, which
      downloads malicious software into the victim’s device when installed.<br />
      As these threats are not always obvious, it is important to teach your child about malware so they do not become victims of these attacks.

  <!--- Malware --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h1>Malware</h1>
    <p>
      Malware attempts to disrupt a computer’s normal function and refers to Viruses, Trojans, Worms, and other programs that infect systems and/or networks to gain access to sensitive data. It can come from email attachments or infected websites and
      files. They can be disguised as legitimate files but contains malicious code to allow attackers to gain access to your device.<br />
      It is important to teach your child about malware as they may not be able to distinguish between good and bad software. If their devices are infected with malware, it can be disruptive to their ability to use their devices, along with other
      physical dangers. Attackers can gain access to your child’s location, photos stored on their phone, and even live feed from their cameras, all without their knowledge. This makes it easier for your child to be scammed, as attackers could find
      your child in-person and pretend to be friends or relatives, tasked with bringing them home, which could put your child in a dangerous situation.<br />
      As an example, if your child plays video games, they may have tried to <a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/scams/2021/11/free-steam-games-videos-promise-much-deliver-malware/">find free versions of games to download and play</a> from
      illegitimate websites. Often, these websites have some form of malware that is harmful to users. When your child downloads the file and runs it, the malware will be installed without their knowledge. This will allow attackers to track what your
      child does across websites, access their files, and even prevent them from accessing their own files.

  <!--- Types of Malware --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h1>Types of Malware</h1>
    <p>
      Malware most commonly infects devices when users click on unknown links, visit suspicious websites, or download software from unknown sources. There are many types of malware, and each operates in a specific manner.<br />
      As children may be impulsive and click on links without checking, they may accidentally infect their devices with malware without realizing it. It is important to teach them to be suspicious of unknown links and to stay away from dangerous and
      suspicious websites so their devices do not get infected.
    </p>

    <h2>Spyware</h2>
    <p>Spyware collects information about the usage of the infected device, sending the information back to the attacker. It can also grant remote access to attackers and is used to steal personal information, as anything the user enters through
      their keyboard can be tracked by the attacker.</p>

    <h2>Adware</h2>
    <p>Adware also collects information about device usage, in order to provide targeted advertisements. Although it is not always malicious, it can slow down the system or direct the browser to unsafe sites which contain other malware.</p>

    <h2>Trojans</h2>
    <p>Trojan malware is disguised to look like legitimate software but is actually malicious. This malware can be used to gain access to personal information, then modify, block, or delete it, causing a lot of harm to the performance of the device.
    </p>

    <h2>Virus</h2>
    <p>Viruses are programs that copy themselves throughout a computer or network, attached to files. It can corrupt or delete data, or send itself to the user’s contacts.</p>
