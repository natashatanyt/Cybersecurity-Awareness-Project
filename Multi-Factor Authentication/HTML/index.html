  <!--- Introduction --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      The importance of multi-factor authentication (MFA) can be shown through the analogy of a safe. Imagine you own a safe that stores many important documents, which thieves are trying to steal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine your safe is protected only by a keypad. Once found, it is only a matter of time until the combination is obtained. On the other hand, if the safe has additional verification steps, such as a fingerprint or iris scanner, it is harder
      for thieves to gain access without your knowledge. Even with the combination to your safe, they would need you present to unlock the safe.

  <!--- MFA --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h1>Multi-Factor Authentication</h1>
    <p>
      MFA requires users to use at least two verification methods to prove their identity before they access their account. This verification process is done with a physical or digital token. Although it increases the time needed to log in, it
      significantly increases the security of a user's account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Children tend to use simple and easy-to-remember passwords. This makes it easy for attackers to figure out their passwords and gain access to their accounts. As a result of data breaches, your child's login details may be leaked. With MFA, it
      makes it harder for attackers to access your child's account even with their login details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although your child's account may not contain sensitive data, attackers can extort your child for money. Recently, <a href="https://www.secureworks.com/blog/ransoms-demanded-for-hijacked-instagram-accounts">there has been a rise in extortion
        cases on Instagram</a>. After being tricked into giving up login details, attackers prevent victims from using their accounts. To regain control, attackers will demand payment. If your child tries to pay off the ransom, they may use your
      credit card,
      which results in monetary losses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Older children will have more sensitive information, as they have accounts such as Singpass or bank accounts. If they use a weak password, attackers can easily access your child's account, especially without MFA. This allows attacker to act
      using the credentials of your child.
