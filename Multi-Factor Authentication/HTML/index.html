  <!--- Introduction --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      The importance of multi-factor authentication (MFA) can be shown through the analogy of a safe. Imagine you own a safe that stores many important documents, which thieves are trying to steal.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your safe only has a keypad to unlock the safe, once the thief finds the safe, it is only a matter of time until they figure out the combination. However, if your safe has another form of verification, such as a fingerprint or iris scanner,
      even if the thief figures out the combination to the safe, it would be much harder for them to gain access to your documents without your knowledge.

  <!--- MFA --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h1>Multi-Factor Authentication</h1>
    <p>
      MFA requires users to use at least two methods of verification to prove their identity before they gain access to their account. This verification process can be done with a physical or digital token. Although it increases the time needed to
      login, it significantly increases the security of a user’s account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Children tend to use simple passwords that are easy to remember, which also makes it easier for attackers to figure out their passwords to gain access to their accounts. Additionally, data breaches occur occasionally, and your child’s login
      details may be leaked. With MFA, it makes it harder for attackers to gain access to your child’s account, even with login details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although you may believe that your child’s accounts have nothing of importance, attackers can try to extort your child for money. Recently, <a href="https://www.secureworks.com/blog/ransoms-demanded-for-hijacked-instagram-accounts">there has
        been a rise in extortion cases on Instagram</a>. After being tricked into giving up login details, attackers will log victims out of their account and demand payment before the account is released to them. If your child wants to pay off the
      ransom, they may use your credit card to do so, which can result in monetary losses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, for older children who have bank accounts, Singpass, and other more important accounts, if they have a weak password, attackers can easily gain access, especially if they do not have MFA enabled. This gives attackers access to
      their accounts and their information, allowing attackers to act with their credentials.
