          The importance of strong passwords can be seen through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)">Mastermind game</a>. For those unfamiliar, it is played with two people: a code maker and a code breaker.<br />
          Using pegs of 6 different colors, the code maker has to create a 4-peg code. The code is hidden from the code breaker, who has a limited number of guesses to figure out the code. Each round, the code breaker places 4 colored pegs in a
          specific order. The code maker gives feedback and the game repeats until the code is figured out, or the code breaker runs out of tries.<br />
          If the code breaker knows the code maker well, they may start by guessing the code maker’s favorite color, which is likely to be somewhere in the password, making it much easier for them to figure out the code. However, if the code maker
          does not include their favorite color, it is harder for the code to be figured out.

  <!--- Safety Tips --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h1>Password Safety</h1>
    <p>
      To link it back to the real world, imagine you are the code maker, keeping all your accounts safe with a password, which the code breaker, an attacker, is trying to find. To prevent them from gaining access to your account, you want a strong
      password that cannot be easily guessed. Additionally, you would want to have different codes for different accounts. This way, even if the attacker does manage to guess one of your passwords, they will not be able to gain access to all your
      accounts.<br />
      If the attacker is able to gain access to your account, they can act with your credentials, or gain access to your data. These attackers may impersonate you, contact people you know, and attempt to scam them. If adults are tricked, the attacker
      may gain access to their financial accounts, which could result in monetary losses.<br />
      Strong passwords are important for privacy and security. At a young age, children may not know how to create and implement strong passwords, relying on parents to create passwords for them.

  <!--- Tip 1: Strong Password --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h2>Have a Strong Password</h2>
    <p>
      It is not difficult to make a <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32040?hl=en">strong password</a>. It usually requires a length of at least 12 characters, with a mix of symbols, numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters. A
      password that is difficult to guess makes it harder for attackers to gain illegal access to your accounts, keeping you safe. <a href="https://www.csa.gov.sg/gosafeonline/resources/password-checker">Test out the strength of passwords here!</a><br />
      To make things slightly easier, a good way of creating a strong password is to use a <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/passphrase">passphrase</a>. This involves a phrase of words that is easy to remember, sometimes
      with slight modifications, such as by adding special characters and numbers. It is an effective way to increase the complexity of your account, while still ensuring that the password is easy to remember. <br />
      If it seems tedious and difficult to create a strong password, you can turn it into a game - all you need is a six-sided dice. <a href="https://www.techradar.com/how-to/create-strong-passwords-with-diceware">Check it out here!</a><br />
      Children may choose to use simple passwords due to convenience and ease, as they may find it difficult to remember complicated passwords. This will make it easy for attackers to brute-force your child’s password, where they try every possible
      combination to try and gain access to these accounts. In addition, children are likely to use the same password on multiple accounts, making it easy for attackers to gain access to most of their accounts.
    </p>

  <!--- Tip 2: Keep Accounts to Yourself --->
    <h2>Keep Your Accounts to Yourself</h2>
    <p>
      When you share your account with others, there is no guarantee they will keep your account details safe and not share it with others. If your details are shared to others with malicious intent, they can log in to the account and access your
      data, <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/sharing-your-streaming-passwords-is-more-dangerous-than-you-think">resulting in a loss of data, or access to your account</a>. This can be dangerous as they could potentially change the email and
      password associated with the account, preventing you from accessing it completely. To extort money from victims, <a href="https://medium.com/technology-hits/instagram-influencer-accounts-hacked-and-being-held-for-ransom-6585d9855708">attackers
      may hold accounts for ransom</a>.<br />
      Children may choose to share their accounts for any reason. While they may trust their friends to keep their account details safe, these details may be shared with their other friends, who may not always have good intentions.<br />
      Children can share their passwords with their parents, but they should not be shared with anyone else. This way, if there is a problem with an online account, parents will be able to step in and help</p>

  <!--- Tip 3: Use Different Passwords --->
    <h2>Use Different Passwords for Different Accounts</h2>
    <p>
      If you use the same password for all your accounts, once the attackers have access to one account, they have access to all your accounts. By using different passwords for different accounts, you can ensure that even if one account is
      compromised, your other accounts are kept safe. These passwords should be completely different from each other as it increases security.<br />
      Children may choose to use the same password out of ease and convenience, as it is much easier to remember one password across all platforms. However, this makes it much easier for attackers to gain access to all their accounts once one account
      is compromised.<br />
      If your child has difficulty remembering multiple passwords, use a password manager! Most browsers have in-built password managers, which securely stores your passwords.
    </p>

  <!--- Tip 4: Do Not Use Personal Information --->
    <h2>Do Not Use Personal Information in Your Passwords</h2>
    <p>
      This includes information such as your name, birthday, address. It is important to use passwords without personal information as it becomes more difficult for attackers to figure out your password.
      <br />
      Children may not know what a good password is, and use something familiar to them so that it is easier for them to remember. However, this also makes it easier for attackers to figure out the password and gain access to the account.

  <!--- Additional Tipcs --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h1>Additional Tips</h1>
    <p>The above-mentioned tips are not entirely foolproof. While it decreases the chances of attackers gaining access to your account, it is still possible for attackers to gain access to your accounts, through exploiting weaknesses in the
      organization’s security. Thus, there are additional steps that can be taken to further ensure your account safety.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use multi-factor authentication</li>
      <li>Avoid falling for social engineering attacks</li>
      <li>Check whether your accounts have been compromised</li>
      <li>If your account has been compromised, check whether other accounts have also been compromised</li>
