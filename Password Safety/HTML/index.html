        The importance of strong passwords can be seen through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)">Mastermind game</a>. For those unfamiliar, it is played with two people: a code maker and a code breaker.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using pegs of 6 different colors, the code maker has to create a 4-peg code. The code is hidden from the code breaker, who has a limited number of guesses to figure out the code. Each round, the code breaker places 4 colored pegs in a
        specific order. The code maker gives feedback and the game repeats until the code is figured out, or the code breaker runs out of tries.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the code breaker knows the code maker well, they may start by guessing the code makerâ€™s favorite color, which is likely to be somewhere in the password, making it much easier for them to figure out the code.

  <!--- Safety Tips --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h1>Password Safety</h1>
    <p>
      If the attacker is able to gain access to your account, they can act with your credentials, or gain access to your data. These attackers may impersonate you, contact people you know, and attempt to scam them, which can result in monetary
      losses.
    </p>

    <!--- Tip 1: Strong Password --->
    <h2>Have a Strong Password</h2>
    <p>
      It is not difficult to make a strong password. It usually requires a length of at least 12 characters, with a mix of symbols, numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters. <a
        href="https://www.csa.gov.sg/gosafeonline/resources/password-checker">Test
        out the strength of various passwords here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make things slightly easier, a good way of creating a strong password is to use a <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/passphrase">passphrase</a>, or turn it into a game - <a
        href="https://www.techradar.com/how-to/create-strong-passwords-with-diceware">all you need is a six-sided dice</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Children may use simple passwords due to convenience and ease. However, a weak password is easy for attackers to figure out by using trial-and-error.
    </p>

    <!--- Tip 2: Keep Accounts to Yourself --->
    <h2>Keep Your Accounts to Yourself</h2>
    <p>
      When you share your account with others, there is no guarantee they will keep your account details safe. Others can login to your account and access your data, which can <a
        href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/sharing-your-streaming-passwords-is-more-dangerous-than-you-think">result in a loss of data, or access to your account</a>. This can be dangerous as they could potentially change the email and password
      associated with the account, preventing you from accessing it completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Children may choose to share their accounts for any reason. While they may trust their friends to keep their account details safe, these details may be shared with their other friends, who may not always have good intentions. Children should
      only share their password with their parents.
    </p>


    <!--- Tip 3: Use Different Passwords --->
    <h2>Use Different Passwords for Different Accounts</h2>
    <p>
      Children may choose to use the same password out of ease and convenience, as it is easy to remember one password. However, once one account is compromised, all accounts with the same username or email and password are vulnerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using different passwords for different accounts, you can ensure that even if one account is compromised, other accounts are kept safe.
    </p>

    <!--- Tip 4: Do Not Use Personal Information --->
    <h2>Do Not Use Personal Information in Your Passwords</h2>
    <p>
      This includes information such as your name, birthday, address. It is important to use passwords without personal information as it becomes more difficult for attackers to figure out your password.
    </p>
    <p>
      Children may not know what a good password is, and use something familiar to them so that it is easier for them to remember. However, this also makes it easier for attackers to figure out the password and gain access to the account.
