      <p>
        The importance of strong passwords can be seen through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)">Mastermind game</a>. For those unfamiliar, it is played with two people: a code-maker and a code-breaker.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using pegs of 6 different colors, the code-maker has to create a 4-peg code. The code is hidden from the code-breaker, who has a limited number of guesses to figure out the code. In each round, the code-breaker places 4 colored pegs in a
        specific order. The code-maker gives feedback and the rounds repeat until the code is figured out, or the code-breaker runs out of tries.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the code-breaker knows the code-maker well, they may start by guessing the code-makerâ€™s favorite color, which is likely to be somewhere in the password, making it much easier for them to figure out the code.

  <!--- Safety Tips --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h1>Password Safety</h1>
    <p>
      If attackers gain access to your account, they can act with your credentials or gain access to your data. These attackers may impersonate your child or attempt to scam your child's contacts, which can result in monetary losses.
    </p>

    <!--- Tip 1: Strong Password --->
    <h2>Have a Strong Password</h2>
    <p>
      It is not difficult to make a strong password. It usually requires a length of at least 12 characters, with a mix of symbols, numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters. <a
        href="https://www.csa.gov.sg/gosafeonline/resources/password-checker">Test
        out the strength of various passwords here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good way of creating a strong password is to use a <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/passphrase">passphrase</a>, or turn it into a game - <a
        href="https://www.techradar.com/how-to/create-strong-passwords-with-diceware">all you need is a six-sided dice</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Children may use simple passwords due to convenience and ease. However, a weak password is easy for attackers to figure out through trial-and-error, known as a brute force attack.
    </p>

    <!--- Tip 2: Keep Accounts to Yourself --->
    <h2>Keep Accounts to Yourself</h2>
    <p>
      When you share your account with others, there is no guarantee they will keep your account details safe. Others can log in to your account and access your data, which can <a
        href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/sharing-your-streaming-passwords-is-more-dangerous-than-you-think">result in a loss of data or access to your account</a>. Attackers could change login details, preventing you from accessing your account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Children may choose to share accounts for any reason. While they may trust their friends to keep their accounts safe, details may be shared with others. These other people may not always have good intentions. Children should only share their
      passwords with their parents.
    </p>


    <!--- Tip 3: Use Different Passwords --->
    <h2>Use Different Passwords for Different Accounts</h2>
    <p>
      Children may use the same password for ease and convenience. However, once one account is compromised, accounts with the same login details are vulnerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using different passwords for different accounts, you can ensure that even if one account is compromised, other accounts are kept safe.
    </p>

    <!--- Tip 4: Do Not Use Personal Information --->
    <h2>Do Not Use Personal Information in Your Passwords</h2>
    <p>
      This includes information such as your name, birthday, and address. It is important to use passwords without personal information as it becomes more difficult for attackers to figure out your password.
    </p>
    <p>
      Children may not know what makes a good password and use something familiar to them so that it is easier for them to remember. However, this also makes it easier for attackers to figure out the password and gain access to the account.
