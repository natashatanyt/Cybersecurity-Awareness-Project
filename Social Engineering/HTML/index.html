  <!--- Introduction --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Attackers can use various methods to collect data and learn about you. With this data, they are able to engineer attacks that manipulate you into giving your login details. In doing so, they are able to gain access to your accounts. This kind
      of attack is known as a Social Engineering Attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some attackers will tailor attacks to increase the likelihood of a successful attack, which can be done by first gathering information about the victim. Others will rely on the curious nature of victims. Therefore, it is important to know the
      different types of attacks to prevent yourself from becoming a victim.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center video">
    <iframe width="700" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9U-JgdUkaTQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
      allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>

  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h2>An Example</h2>
    <p>
      These social engineering threats may not always be very obvious. Attackers trying to gather information can do it in inconspicuous ways, such as through the following image, taken from <a
        href="https://www.epicreads.com/blog/ya-fantasy-title-generator/">EpicReads</a>.
    </p>

    <div class="container-fluid image-div">
      <img src="../Images/ASOWAR_TitleGenerator_Final6.jpg" alt="Example of Gathering Information">
    </div>
    <p>
      This image encourages users to post and share personal details. In this case, users are encouraged to share their zodiac sign, favorite genre and the last digit of their phone number. If users post their response online, attackers can use this
      to collect data on potential victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this situation, the attacker would be able to figure out a range of possible dates for your child’s birthday, as well as their favorite genre, making it easier for attackers to interact with them. If they find out through conversation that
      your child plays a popular online mobile game, they can create an attack that claims to give free prizes for that game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Children who are not aware of online safety may choose to share their information, giving up this information to attackers. With this information, attackers are able to effectively create scams or other attacks to trick you into revealing your
      login information.
    </p>
    <p>
      With access to your child’s accounts, attackers may be able to impersonate them, trick their friends into giving up information, <a href="../../Doxxing/HTML/index.html">doxx</a> them, or spread
      <a href="../../Malware/HTML/index.html">malware</a> to your child’s contacts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Social engineering attacks can be very hard to spot. It is important to educate your child about social engineering so they can keep themselves safe even without your supervision.
    </p>

  <!--- Types of Attacks --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h1>Types of Attacks</h1>

    <!--- Baiting --->
    <h2 class="reduce-margin">Baiting</h2>
    <p>
      This type of attack relies on the curiosity of victims to infect systems with <a href="../../Malware/HTML/index.html">malware</a>. It can happen through the use of physical media, where flash drives are left in obvious spots for the victim to
      pick up and insert into their devices.</p>
    </p>
    <p>
      Children may pick up a flash drive and insert it into their device to try and figure out who it belongs to, resulting in malware being installed on their computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, victims may be baited by the false promise of free items, given in exchange for personal information, such as their full name, address, or credit card details. Free items, especially when coming
      from unofficial websites, are likely to be a scam. To learn about other dangers of online gaming, <a href="../../Gaming/HTML/index.css">click here</a>.
    </p>


    <!--- Phishing --->
    <h2>Phishing</h2>
    <p>
      This attack tries to trick victims into giving up their login details. This usually happens by creating a feeling of fear, or a feeling of excitement. The attacker tries to impersonate someone trustworthy, sending a link to the victim that
      prompts them to enter their account details for a particular organization, which is then is sent to the attackers, giving them access to the victim’s account.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this information, attackers can impersonate your child and attempt to phish their contacts. This can cause distress to your child, as they will have to reach out to their friends to inform them, or to deal with the aftermath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Children may not know the difference between a real and fake link. They may enter their login information without realizing it is sent to the attackers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below is an example of a phishing email. Click on the image to see the reasons why it is a phishing email!
    </p>

    <div class="phishing-email">
      <button type="button" class="btn phishing-example" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#exampleModal">
        <img src="../Images/Phishing Example.png" alt="">
      </button>
    </div>

    <!-- Modal -->
    <div class="modal fade" id="exampleModal" tabindex="-1" aria-labelledby="exampleModalLabel" aria-hidden="true">
      <div class="modal-dialog modal-fullscreen">
        <div class="modal-content">
          <div class="modal-body">
            <div class="row">
              <div class="phishing-email col-12 col-md-6">
                <img src="../Images/Phishing Elaborated.png" class="phishing-elaboration" alt="">
              </div>
              <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
                <ul>
                  <li>The sender's email is misspelt "jaosn" instead of "jason".</li>
                  <li>The content of the email is about answers for upcoming exams, which would make you want to click on it.</li>
                  <li>The link is "http", which is not a secure website, and is vulnerable to attacks.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="modal-footer">

    <!--- Scareware --->
    <h2>Scareware</h2>
    <p>
      This attack relies on creating a sense of fear in victims. Often, the victim will see a pop-up banner which states something similar to:
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
      Your computer may be infected with harmful spyware programs! Click here to download xyz program and remove it.
    </div>
    <p>
      Clicking the link and installing the program results in malware being installed on the device, giving the attacker access to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Children may be afraid and believe that their device is actually infected with malware. As they may fear getting into trouble with their parents, they may click on the link to try and resolve the ‘problem’ themselves, resulting in them
      downloading <a href="../../Malware/HTML/index.html">malicious programs</a>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!--- Additional Tips --->
