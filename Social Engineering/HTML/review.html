          Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly common, especially since these attacks can be carried out and sent to a large number of people at once. Moreover, as it relies on the weak security practices of the victims and manipulates them, it
          is easier for attackers to successfully trick others.

    <!--- Question 2 --->
    <div class="qn-container">
      <h2 class="question">You are walking down a very busy road when you see a thumb drive on the ground. It is in a very obvious place, and you dont see anyone going towards it. What should you do?</h2>
      <div class="choice-container correct">
        <p class="choice-prefix col-1">A</p>

          If you see a thumbdrive on the ground, you should leave it there. It may be a baiting attack, which downloads malware into your device when inserted. If it does belong to someone who misplaced it, they will likely retrace their steps to try
          and find their thumbdrive. By leaving it there, is it easier for them to spot the thumbdrive.

          Scareware manipulates you by scaring you into believing your device is infected or faulty in some way. It tries to trick you into downloading malicious software under the guise that it will solve the issue you are currently facing. If you
          worry that your device is infected, run a scan on your device.

        <p>
          You should never share information that can be used to figure out who you are, as it will allow strangers to stalk you, or get close to you by pretending to be someone close to your family. You can still share some information, such as your
          favorite food, color, or music genre. Anything that will help strangers figure out where you live, what school you are from or places you visit frequently should be kept secret.

    <!--- Question 5 --->
    <div class="qn-container">
      <h2 class="question">Which of the following are signs that you have received a phishing email?</h2>
      <div class="choice-container">
        <p class="choice-prefix col-1">A</p>
        <p class="choice-text" data-number="1">URL in the message is different from the URL when your mouse cursor hovers over the link</p>
      </div>
      <div class="choice-container">
        <p class="choice-prefix col-1">B</p>
        <p class="choice-text" data-number="2">The name of the organization is misspelled</p>
      </div>
      <div class="choice-container">
        <p class="choice-prefix col-1">C</p>
        <p class="choice-text" data-number="3">The sender's email address is different from the organization they claim to be from</p>
      </div>
      <div class="choice-container correct">
        <p class="choice-prefix col-1">D</p>
        <p class="choice-text" data-number="4">All of the above</p>
      </div>
      <div class="explanation">
        <p>
          Once you learn the signs, phishing emails are relatively easy to spot. The signs include having a URL that directs to a different link, a misspelled organization name, or if the sender has a different email than the organization they claim
          to be from. Other signs include spelling mistakes in the body of the email, or if the email urges you to act immediately.
