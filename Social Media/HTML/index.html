    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <div class="container-fluid introduction-content">
      <p>
        Many children use social media as a way to stay in contact with their friends and to share about their lives. However, with the anonymity provided by the internet, strangers with bad intentions may befriend your child for nefarious purposes.
        Additionally, your child may overshare online as they believe it is a safe space, unaware that anything that they post cannot be easily removed.
        <br />
        It is important to educate your child about the dangers of social media and online etiquette so that they keep themselves safe. If your child is prone to oversharing online, they may accidentally reveal information that may result in them
        being stalked.
        <br />
        With all their information publicly available, it is easy for attackers to impersonate your child, or pretend to be a family friend and interact with your child. Moreover, if your child becomes a victim of doxxing, it is easy for attackers to
        find and collate information about them.
        <br />
        It is important to educate your child to be mindful of what they post online, especially if their account is public. Encourage them to check their social media account and see what personal information can be found just by looking at their
        posts, such as their school or names of family members and friends.

    <h2>Tips to Stay Safe</h2>

  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <p>
      To be safer online, there are a few things you can encourage your child to do.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!--- Tip 1: Avoid Posting Your Regular Schedule Online --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h2>Avoid Posting Your Regular Schedule Online</h2>
    <p>
      By posting about yourself regularly, others may be able to track your patterns and habits. As a result, others will learn a lot more about your child than intended and will be able to stalk your child.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!--- Tip 2: Avoid Sharing Your Personal Information Online --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h2>Avoid Sharing Your Personal Information Online</h2>
    <p>
      By sharing your personal information, attackers may be able to devise social engineering attacks to trick your child into giving up information. Additionally, attackers may be able to figure out your child’s favorite shops, school, and even
      your address, giving attackers the ability to stalk your child.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!--- Tip 3: Make Your Account Private --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h2>Make Your Account Private</h2>
    <p>
      With a private account, your posts will be hidden from the general public. For others to be able to view their account, they will need to be ‘accepted’. As a result, your child will be safer online as their posts will only be seen by those they
      have accepted.
      <br />
      Even though your child’s account may be set to private, they may have accepted people that they do not know personally. This may happen because they have mutual friends/followers on that platform, making these strangers appear more trustworthy
      than they are. If your child is unsure of who the person is, they should not accept the request.
    </p>

  <!--- Grooming --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h1>Grooming</h1>
    <p>A potential danger of social media and online interactions is grooming, which is when an adult befriends a child with the purpose of exploiting them.
      <br />
      Young children that are active online are more likely to be targeted, as they are likely to interact with others. They are also naturally trusting and may be prone to oversharing with strangers, especially if that person is nice. Your child may
      be afraid to tell you if they are in this situation as they may have been manipulated by the predator Thus, it is important to educate them on this topic and tell your child that they can talk to you if they find themselves in this situation.
      <br />
      It is difficult to figure out who your child talks to online, as there is a level of anonymity. You can never be sure that the person you are speaking to is who they say they are. Thus, it can be hard to keep track of your child’s interactions
      online and to figure out what intentions the other party has. By teaching them to be safe and spot signs that they are being exploited, you can help prevent your child from being groomed.

  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">

    <h2>Stages of Grooming</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Friendship Forming - In this stage, the predator targets a child and begins to befriend them, learning about them and their family.</li>
      <li>Relationship Forming - Next, they build a relationship with the child, fulfilling the child’s needs, and ingraining themself into the life of the child.</li>
      <li>Gauging Threat - After that, the predator asks questions to figure out how close the child is to the family and senses the likelihood of successfully grooming the child.</li>
      <li>Isolating the Child - After that, they will assert that they share a special bond with the child, making them feel special, and to try and spend as much time as possible with the child.</li>
      <li>Maintaining Control - Lastly, the predator will continue to try to maintain a relationship with the child.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Signs of a Predator</h2>
    <p>While these are symptoms that your child is being groomed, if your child exhibits these signs, it does not always mean that they are being groomed. Talk to your child if you suspect they are being groomed.
      <br />
      Your child <em>may</em> be a victim if they:
    <ul>
      <li>Ask to spend more time on the Internet</li>
      <li>Are secretive about the sites they visit or who they talk to online</li>
      <li>Switch screens when you go near them</li>
      <li>Use age-inappropriate language</li>
      <li>Have volatile emotions</li>
    </ul>
