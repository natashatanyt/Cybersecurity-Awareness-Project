  <!--- Introduction --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h1>Social Media Safety</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Many children use social media as a way to stay in contact with their friends and to share about their lives. However, with the anonymity provided by the internet, strangers with bad intentions may befriend your child for nefarious purposes.
      Additionally, your child may overshare online as they believe it is a safe space, unaware that anything that they post cannot be easily removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to educate your child about the dangers of social media and online etiquette so that they keep themselves safe. If your child is prone to oversharing online, they may accidentally reveal information that may result in them
      being stalked.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all their information publicly available, it is easy for attackers to impersonate your child, or pretend to be a family friend and interact with your child. Moreover, if your child becomes a victim of doxxing, it is easy for attackers to
      collate information about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to educate your child to be mindful of what they post online, especially if their account is public. Encourage them to check their social media account and see what personal information can be found just by looking at their
      posts, such as their school or names of family members and friends, and remove those posts.

    <!--- Social Media Safety --->
    <h2>Tips to Stay Safe</h2>
    <p>
      To be safer online, there are a few things you can encourage your child to do.
    </p>

    <!--- Tip 1: Avoid Posting Your Regular Schedule Online --->
    <h2>Avoid Posting Your Regular Schedule Online</h2>
    <p>
      By posting about yourself regularly, others may be able to track your patterns and habits. As a result, others will learn a lot more about your child than intended and will be able to stalk your child.
    </p>

    <!--- Tip 2: Avoid Sharing Your Personal Information Online --->
    <h2>Avoid Sharing Your Personal Information Online</h2>
    <p>
      By sharing information about you and/or your child, attackers may be able to figure out your favourite shops, address and even figure out your daily routine, giving attackers the ability to stalk your child. Additionally, they may be able to
      devise social engineering attacks to trick your child into giving up information.
    </p>

    <!--- Tip 3: Make Your Account Private --->
    <h2>Make Your Account Private</h2>
    <p>
      With a private account, your posts will be hidden from the general public. For others to be able to view their account, they will need to be ‘accepted’. As a result, your will be safer online as your posts will only be seen by those accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though your account may be set to private, you may have accepted people that they do not know personally. This may happen because you have mutual friends/followers on that platform, making these strangers appear more trustworthy than they
      are. If you are unsure of who the person is, they should not accept the request.
    </p>

  <!--- Grooming --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h1>Grooming</h1>
    <p>
      A potential danger of social media and online interactions is grooming, which is when an adult befriends a child with the purpose of exploiting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young children that are active online are more likely to be targeted, as they are naturally trusting and may be prone to oversharing with strangers. Your child may be unaware if caught in this situation, or may be afraid of telling you. By
      educating your child about this topic, your child can avoid becoming a victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is difficult to figure out who your child talks to online due to the level of anonymity. You can never be sure that the person your child speaks to is who they say they are. Thus, it can be hard to keep track of your child’s interactions
      online and to figure out what intentions the other party has. By teaching them to be safe and spot signs that they are being exploited, you can help prevent your child from being groomed.
    </p>

    <h2>Signs of a Predator</h2>
    <p>While these are symptoms that your child is being groomed, if your child exhibits these signs, it does not always mean that they are being groomed. Talk to your child if you suspect they are being groomed.</p>
    <p>
      Your child <b>may</b> be a victim if they:
    <ul>
      <li>Ask to spend more time on the Internet</li>
      <li>Are secretive about the sites they visit or who they talk to online</li>
      <li>Switch screens when you go near them</li>
      <li>Use inappropriate language</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  </div>

  <!--- Additional Tips --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h1>Additional Tips</h1>
    <p>To protect your child, you can also:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Allow them to use devices in open spaces with trusted adults around</li>
      <li>Choose high privacy settings for their social media and gaming accounts</li>
      <li>Remind your child to never share personal information that can be used to identify them</li>
      <li>Turn off location tracking on devices and software that do not require it</li>
