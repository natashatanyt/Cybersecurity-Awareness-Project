  <!--- Introduction --->

    <h1>Social Media Safety</h1>
    <p>
      Many children use social media as a way to stay in contact with their friends and to share about their lives. It is important to educate your child about the dangers of social media and online etiquette so that they stay safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your child should be mindful of what they post online, especially if their account is public. Encourage them to check their social media account and remove posts with personal information as it could be used to identify them. Posting personal
      information leaves them vulnerable to stalkers or doxxing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, if they are not careful with what they say online, it can hinder job searches in the future or <a href="https://itsblossom.com/blog/2019/08/26/people-fired-over-social-media/">get them fired from their current job</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
      Being careless with information posted online can lead to your child being stalked, as people who can see their accounts will know what they are doing at every moment. Moreover, attackers can learn about your child, making them susceptible to
      phishing attacks which may lead to monetary losses.

    <h2>How to Stay Safe Online</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid posting your regular schedule online</li>
      <li>Avoid sharing personal information online</li>
      <li>Make your account private</li>
    </ul>

  <!--- Grooming --->
  <div class="container-fluid align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <h1>Grooming</h1>
    <p>
      A potential danger of social media and online interaction is grooming, which is when an adult befriends a child with the purpose of exploiting them. Children may overshare, which makes it easier for attackers to bond with your child to exploit
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is difficult to figure out whether the person you speak to is who they claim to be. With the level of anonymity provided, it is much easier for attackers to hide their identity and intentions. By teaching them to be safe and spot signs that
      they are being exploited, you can help prevent your child from being groomed.
    </p>


    <h2>Signs of a Predator</h2>
    <p class="reduce-margin">Your child may be a victim if they:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ask to spend more time on the Internet</li>
      <li>Are secretive about the sites they visit or who they talk to online</li>
      <li>Switch screens when you go near them</li>
      <li>Use age-inappropriate language</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While these are symptoms that your child is being groomed, if they exhibit these signs, it does not mean that they are being groomed.</p>
